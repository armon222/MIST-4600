## Problem Description:

The challenge is to model and build a relational database for the operations of a new football club called the Georgia Lions. In the model, the main entity is Players, which describes all of the players personal information and statistics on the field. The other entities either support, magnify, monetize, or track player performance and relationships with other parts of the Georgia Lions operation. For this new team, we want to comprehensively model these relationships, obtain data for the entities, and use queries to answer questions which will help evaluate performance on and off the field of the club.
